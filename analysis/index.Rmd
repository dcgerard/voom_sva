The goal of this repo is to use confounder adjustment methods in conjunction with voom. That is, perhaps we can obtain more accurate voom precision weights while also estimating the degree and form of hidden confounding.

Index of notebooks:

1. [Create a dataset of characteristics of GTEX data.](gtex_characteristics.html) This is for use in the `seqgendiff` R package for `theogen`
2. [VOOM weights are moderately variable when changing design matrix](voom_seqgendiff.html). Does this indicate that accounting for unobserved confounding would improve the voom weight estimates? One of the benefits of VOOM is its speed. Would we compromize this too much in trying to account for unobserved confounding? It could be good to first try out voom normalization using control genes.
3. [See if iterating voom steps changes the results.](iterate_voom.Rmd) On first glance, it seems to not change much if at all.
